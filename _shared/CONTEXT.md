# Factory inputs

One job: hold reusable configuration and common rules, separate from customer runs.

| File | Owner |
|---|---|
| [rules.md](rules.md) | Common evidence and action boundaries |
| [policy.example.json](policy.example.json) | Portable example values copied once to ignored policy.json |
| [adapters.example.md](adapters.example.md) | Adapter questionnaire copied once to ignored adapters.md |

Inputs: the [setup questionnaire](../setup/questionnaire.md) and approved configuration changes.
Process: change each fact in its owning file. Load only the selected workflow's sections.
Outputs: local policy.json and adapters.md; further files are declared by setup.
Human check: review the exact configuration and adapter capabilities before live use.
Credentials and run data never belong here. See [portability](../setup/portability.md).
